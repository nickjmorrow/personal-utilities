# personal-utilities

Just a small CLI for doing common tasks. Code is very raw/unrefined. 

Currently supports:
- saving a database to a file, `utl save "anything here"`, produces `anything_here.bak`
- restoring a database from a file, `utl restore anything_here.bak` or `utl restore "anything here"`
